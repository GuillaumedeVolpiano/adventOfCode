# adventOfCode
These are my forays into solving Advent of Code in Haskell.

For all years before 2023, these is actually my second time solving these
problems in Haskell, but the first was not uploaded to GitHub and is lost for
now.

The canonical branch contains implementation of the most often used solution
according to r/adventofcode when my own solution was much less efficient.
